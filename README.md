# leetcode-notes



### Descriptions

This is a journal of my Everyday-LeetCode problems. I will drop down whatever information that seems helpful for me. This is also proof of I am practicing something in a daily manner, and this also provides useful resources for my future (whenever the algorithm could help). 

Also, the establishment of this repo (Feb 16, 2022) is a small souvenir of finishing my first 100 LeetCode problems. 



### Citation
Until further notice, my solutions/approach to problems and my ordering of problems are referring to this [guide](https://github.com/youngyangyang04/leetcode-master). My plan is to finish this guide first, then I will practice problems by tags. 



### Language
My notes language is in English, while some parts could be in Chinese for a more intuitive understanding.

My coding language is `python`.
